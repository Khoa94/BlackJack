The game used to work but currently doesn't work on the new XCode. I haven't updated the game to conform with the updates for XCode.

I still have the game on my iPod Touch and it works fine. If you want me to show you the game, please message me at nguyenkh@grinnell.edu and we can set up a Google Hangout or Skype and I'll show you the game via webcam.
